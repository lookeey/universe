There are a few different ways time can be calculated in the Universe. Broadly used and accepted methods include the [[Dunex#Time System|Dunexian Time System]].

## Time Systems
### Dunexian Time System
The Dunexian Time System is based on the orbital period of the Lintua binary star system, rather than a planetary orbital period (commonly used among solar systems). It is widely used in electronics and interstellar travel, with most equipment having interchangeable time system protocols based on it. Galactic historic records use this system due to its universality and usability.
As a simple example, the Kwerian War lasted over 4.3 Dunexian years, from 6370dn to 6374dn. Dunexian time is rarely used to indicate specific, narrower moments; instead local planetary day-night cycles are significantly more efficient in those circumstances.
