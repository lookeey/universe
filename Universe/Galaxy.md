"The Galaxy" is often used to refer to the galaxy's habitable zone, rather than the whole galactic system.

## Organization
The galaxy is divided in four ring sections, respectively, from the center:
- Core
- Inner Field
- The Ring
- Outer Field

![[Division.png|250]]

The Ring, being the only naturally habitable zone, is subdivided in 32 equally-sized sectors, of which 19 are widely inhabited by advanced civilization. Multiple government systems have been established throughout the millennia, being most of those highly volatile. In the Graam Era, the galaxy achieved relative peace, with 27 sectors are under the [[Great Graam's Technocracy]]'s supervision. Sectors 20\-24 refuse to serve under the Graam's Technocracy rule. Sectors 22 and 23 are sparsely inhabited, and their population is mostly comprised of tribal hunter-gatherers or manual workers serving nearby systems in exchange of low grade technology. Sectors 20, 21 and 24 in the other hand are the leading members of the [[Thark Alliance]] and possess greatly advanced technology.

## Travel
Traveling through the galaxy can be a exhaustive and expensive task, depending on the region. Relatively fast interstellar travel can be done exclusively through [[Gate|Gates]].
