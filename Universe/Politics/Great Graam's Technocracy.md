The Great Graam's Technocracy is an authoritarian government regime established in the sectors 25-32 and 01-19, that rules mainly using social engineering.

## Social Privilege System
Individual rights under the Technocracy are determined through diverse ways, accordingly to the different types of civilization and culture inside the domain. In most advanced societies, the tiniest of details about an individual's behavior is tracked and recorded. An automatic system or designated personnel then determine their rights and privileges through algorithms or direct judgment.
The operations – made possible by huge corporations of the public sector – are unknown by most of the people; those who suspect of their existence are eventually discretely silenced. 
Primitive societies do not use such an intricate process; they are instead controlled through inexpensive rewarding.

## Acceptance
These methods were put into question by the governments that later formed the [[Thark Alliance]] as the Technocracy grew stronger through the galaxy and rumors about its methods spread. Refusing to operate under such authority, 58 planets and moons from sectors 20-24 united forces against the scientific empire. The superior technology from the [[Dunex|Dunex System]], Kollemir, and others allowed the resistance to grow stronger across the years.
