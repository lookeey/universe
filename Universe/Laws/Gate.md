Gates are gigantic stellar generators which main purpose is to provide efficient interstellar travel. They consist of dome-shaped structures that orbit a host star and concentrate its radiation into a core. The energy is then used to power a fold generator. Any accepted spaceship can enter a gate and communicate with the system to request a spatial jump to the requested gate. Some of those machines can perform jumps to multiple destinations.

## Interways
Consecutive gates forming a line form a Interway. Interways are strategically assembled to provide the fastest means of travel possible. Those can cross or intersect on gates that support multiple destinations.

## Management
Most gates are managed by a government and may or may not require payment, depending both on its owner and user.
The [[Great Graam's Technocracy]] allows selected members to use their jump services without fees, based on the [[Great Graam's Technocracy#Social Privilege System|Social Privilege System]]. Not all gates are under the government's ownership; remote areas often are made accessible by private industries, that require variable fees to provide jumps.
